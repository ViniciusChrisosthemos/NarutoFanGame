# Naruto Game
The development of this game is non-profit. The game is just a project to practice my game development skills in Unity. If you have any interesting mechanics to add or suggestions for changes, please leave them in the comments. 

OBS: All artwork/audio used in this project was taken from Google Images and Youtube. I just implemented the mechanics.
